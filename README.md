# This is the repository for STAT 545 Homework 05.
In this assignment, I will attempt to do the following tasks:

* Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate the effect in arranged data and in figures.
* Write some data to file and load it back into R.
* Improve a figure (or make one from scratch), using new knowledge, e.g., control the color scheme, use factor levels, smoother mechanics.
* Make a plotly visual.
* Implement visualization design principles.
* Save a figure to file, and read it from file as well.
